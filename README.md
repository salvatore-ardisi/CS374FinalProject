1. What is/are the problem/s you want to solve? Please provide background based on research.

We want to make completing assignments more manageable in a timely fashion. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management system widely used by many today that breaks tasks into chunks on a timer while combining short breaks in between. We want to integrate this time management technique with keeping track of assignments more efficiently. With this implementation, when you are completing an assignment with multiple steps, you can set the timer to complete one step for a specific amount of time, take a break, and move to the next step in the assignment.

2. Who are the users you are targeting? Please use a Persona to describe your users and draw a picture of your target user. 

This application is intended for students who struggle with time management and organization in completing assignments. However, it can be intended for anyone wanting to focus on completing several multi-step tasks for a given period of time. Kevin is a student who has several projects and assignments to complete by a deadline. He struggles to find the time taken to complete each assignment and does not know where to start. He would love an app that allows him to plan all his assignments, steps/time taken to complete each assignment, and a time management technique to use in order to manage his time more efficiently. He also would like a few tips on how to stay more productive when completing these tasks.
