1. What is/are the problem/s you want to solve? Please provide background based on research.

We want to make completing assignments more manageable in a timely fashion. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management system widely used by many today that breaks tasks into chunks on a timer while combining short breaks in between. We want to integrate this time management technique with keeping track of assignments more efficiently. With this implementation, when you are completing an assignment with multiple steps, you can set the timer to complete one step for a specific amount of time, take a break, and move to the next step in the assignment.

2. Who are the users you are targeting? Please use a Persona to describe your users and draw a picture of your target user. 

This application is intended for students who struggle with time management and organization in completing assignments. However, it can be intended for anyone wanting to focus on completing several multi-step tasks for a given period of time. Kevin is a student who has several projects and assignments to complete by a deadline. He struggles to find the time taken to complete each assignment and does not know where to start. He would love an app that allows him to plan all his assignments, steps/time taken to complete each assignment, and a time management technique to use in order to manage his time more efficiently. He also would like a few tips on how to stay more productive when completing these tasks.

3. What are the major features of the solution? List the features.

Some major features include: 
task/project list with the ability to add due dates, task steps, and descriptions to minimize project generalization,
Pomodoro timer for completing a specific task and break timer, and helpful tips for staying productive, including use of Google maps to show local study spots (libraries, cafes, etc)

4. How is this solution unique? How does it relate to existing solutions on the market? What are three solutions similar or related to what you want to do in the Google Play Store?

There are  many apps on the app store that combine the Pomodoro Technique and organization of assignments/tasks. Three solutions related include: Focus To-Do, Pomodoro Timer, and Egenda. Egenda organizes and manages assignments for classes in a minimalistic fashion. Pomodoro Timer offers a customizable task and break timer. Focus To-Do offers a more complex combination of Egenda and Pomodoro Timer functionalities, such as organization of tasks and an additional timer to each sub task. Our application will be similar to these solutions, but we aim to provide a more minimalistic, beginner friendly, and easy approach in organizing assignments with a Pomodoro timer. Additionally, we would like to add a “Tips” functionality to the app that offers useful tips for staying productive while using organization and time management techniques. See screenshots for the related apps mentioned below.
